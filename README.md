Convolutional Neural Network

This is a implementaion on CNN using a dog and cat dataset from kaggle.com
The dataset was shortened in order to get the implementaion done of local computer easily. You can download the original data and implement the same on the dataset.
The model will work well. I have achieved an accuracy of 84% for my test set which originally was only 70% approx. The achievement of better ccuracy is done by adding another convolution layer. There is also another way of adding another dense layer which will also work fine and will also give a higher accuracy for the given dataset.
Feel free to correct me and reach me for any help or suggestion.
